<p> I am studying for my PhD in <a href="https://www.fox.temple.edu/departments/statistical-science/" target="_blank">Statistics</a> as Presidential Fellow at Temple University under advisors Dr. Edo Airoldi and Dr. Kenichiro McAlinn. My research interests are always expanding, but I am currently focused on the areas of Bayesian ensemble learning and causal inference.
<p> I graduated from UVa in 2020 with a major in Mathematics, a minor in Physics, and significant coursework in Philosophy. At UVa, I designed and taught my own class on the intersection of Physics and Philosophy, and I was a Teaching Assistant for the Economics Department during my fourth year. 

<p>I love investigative projects and developing new research methods. Also, as much as I love math and statistics on their own, I know the importance of collaborating with domain experts and applying cutting edge theory to solve real world problems.
